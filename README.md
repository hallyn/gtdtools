# GTD scripts

## Introduction

I've been using GTD for over a decade.  I've been developing and using
these scripts for almost as long.

If you run setup.sh from this directory, it will by default setup;

1. ~/gtd as a base directory for the GTD files
1. ~/gtd/tickler as the tickler directory
1. ~/gtd/Projects as the project directory, and ~/gtd/Completed as the completed project directory
1. ~/gtd/next_actions.otl as the (vimoutliner) next actions file
1. ~/gtd/done.otl as the (vimoutliner) done file
1. ~/bin/update_repeating as the script to update the tickler files each month
1. ~/bin/tick as the script to run each day to view your daily tickler files
1. ~/bin/project (alias p) as the script to manage projects

As I find time, I'll add more detailed information below.
